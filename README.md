## 🔍 Cluster Analysis | 聚类分析
- Optimal K = 3 (tested with silhouette coefficient)  
- **Group 1 (56%)**: Low price, low attention (Honda, Wuling)  
- **Group 2 (23%)**: Low price, high attention (BYD, Toyota)  
- **Group 3 (20%)**: Mid-to-high price, high attention (Audi, Denza)  

**Business Suggestion | 商业建议**  
- Platforms: Stratified user operations, targeted promotion  
- Automakers: Focus resources on high-potential segments  
- Brands: Clarify positioning and optimize competitive strategies

## 🌳 Decision Tree | 决策树
- **Core Features**: Brand type (mainstream vs. others), Minimum price  
- **Key Rules**:  
  1. Min price ≤ 139k + mainstream brand → High Attention (Coverage 68.9%)  
  2. Min price ≤ 139k + other brand → Low Attention (Coverage 53.5%)  
  3. Min price > 452k → Low Attention (Coverage 100%)  

**Business Value | 商业价值**  
- Quickly screen promotional models  
- Eliminate low-potential high-priced models  
- Balance brand and price dimensions for strategic layout  

---

## ✅ Conclusion | 结论
- Market can be divided into **three clear segments**: affordable daily-use vehicles, mid-to-high-end new energy vehicles, and premium models.  
- Price ≤ 250,000 yuan is the **core threshold** for distinguishing user attention.  
- Leading brands succeed with **multi-model coverage + targeted pricing** strategies.  
- Data-driven segmentation enables automakers to **reduce marketing costs and optimize positioning**.
